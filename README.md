## Installation

### GitHub Codespaces

1. Clone this repository into your codespace:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. Run the installation script:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Restart your shell or source your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```

### Local Development

1. Clone this repository to your home directory:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
   ```

2. Make the installation script executable and run it:
   ```bash
   cd ~/.dotfiles
   chmod +x install.sh
   ./install.sh
   ```

3. Install the development tools meta-package (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   # Install from the APT repository or GitHub releases
   # See Meta Package section below for installation instructions
   ```

4. Set zsh as your default shell (if not already):
   ```bash
   chsh -s $(which zsh)
   ```

5. Restart your terminal or source your shell configuration:
   ```bash
   exec zsh
   ```

## How It Works

The `install.sh` script:
- Creates XDG Base Directory structure (`~/.config`, `~/.local/share`, `~/.cache`)
- Symlinks configuration files from `config/` subdirectories to `~/.config/`
- Files with `.home` extension are symlinked to `$HOME` instead (e.g., `.zshenv.home` â†’ `$HOME/.zshenv`)
- Preserves existing configurations by backing them up
- Supports easy updates by re-running the script

## Configuration Details

- **Zsh**: Configurations in `config/zsh/` directory
  - `config.zsh`: Environment variables and XDG paths
  - `alias.zsh`: Custom aliases
  - `history.zsh`: History configuration with Atuin integration
  - `nord.dircolors`: Nord color scheme for `ls`
- **Starship**: Prompt configuration in `config/starship/starship.toml`
- **Claude**: Claude Code settings in `config/claude/settings.json`
